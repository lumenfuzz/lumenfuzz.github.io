I got started with coding seven years ago back in college, leaving it shortly after to try other things.  When I first came to programming, working with C++ and Java, coding was usually easy, but it occasionally I'd run into big headaches just because my syntax was wrong and I couldn't figure out why it was wrong.   And at the time, since I was only doing coding because I was good at it, when push came to shove I decided to look elsewhere for something more meaningful (and less frustrating).

I'm not sure how or why it happened, but despite my frustration with it, my mind took to coding like a fish to water.  Even with my coding days long behind me, I idly generated solutions to my problems as though I were writing a computer script.  And even after I solved the problem, I'd continue refining it as though I were teaching someone else how to solve the same problem.  So recently I decided to give coding another go and began the curriculum at Flatiron.

What I've liked about my return is how natural the Ruby language is, and how straightforward the test-based approach (that Flatiron uses) makes coding.  I'm still surprised by how often I'll write code and all the tests just pass the first time.  Really, the most frustrating thing I've had to deal wtih so far is working with HTML and CSS, what with it being so heavily syntax-based.  I know that I won't always be able to work with whatever language I want, but it still is quite encouraging to know that there are options to make coding feel natural.
