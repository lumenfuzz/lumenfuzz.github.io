As I've been working my way through grasping how to use Javascript, I've been finding that without pry (as in Ruby), I can't see what my program is doing.  What's more, logging to the console doesn't work in my situation because the log gets picked up by the learn.co testing script.  So I've generally set myself to solving the problem more literally, using the error output as a rudimentary test.

I am nearly at learn.co's Advanced Javascript, and it's only now that I'm realizing I can get better feedback by running snippets in the web browser first.  So even though I've started getting into the habit of just putting my nose to the grindstone and working through the labs, already it's becoming clear I can save time (and frustration) by stepping back every now and then to get a better sense of the field surrounding the smaller issues.

I am looking forward to learning more on how to create my own tests in Javascript.
